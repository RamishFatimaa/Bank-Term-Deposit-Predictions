## Initial Business Questions

The initial business questions we proposed are as follows:

1. Can we find out the bank's operation status by looking into these individual bank customers' usage records? Any potential problems or risks revealed by the data?
2. How to predict whether a customer would subscribe to the term deposit service? What factors affect the customers' choice most?
3. Can we cluster the customers into different segments for further marketing purposes?
